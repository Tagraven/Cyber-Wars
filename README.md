Overview:

Cyber Wars is a strategic cybersecurity card game that simulates the complex and dynamic world of global cyber operations. Players assume the roles of various nation-states or cyber groups, each vying for dominance in cyberspace. Through the deployment of offensive and defensive cyber assets, players engage in tactical maneuvers to protect their critical national infrastructure (CNI) while attempting to disrupt their opponents' operations. Cyber Wars is not just about winning; it's about learning the intricacies of cybersecurity, understanding global threat landscapes, and developing essential skills for cybersecurity professionals.

How It Works
Deck Selection: Players choose from a variety of decks representing different cyber actors (e.g., USA, Russia, China, Anonymous). Each deck includes unique offensive and defensive assets, incident response teams, and cyber attacks.

Objective Cards: Players draw objective cards that determine their victory conditions, such as disrupting a specific infrastructure or achieving cyber dominance.

Game Phases:

Asset Phase: Players deploy offensive or defensive assets to strengthen their position or prepare for an attack.
Attack Phase: Players launch cyber attacks against their opponents, applying stress to their defenses. Successful attacks can damage opponents' CNI.
Winning the Game: The game is won when a player successfully achieves the objective outlined on their objective card.

What It Teaches
Cyber Wars provides players with practical experience in managing cyber threats and defending critical infrastructure. It enhances understanding of global cybersecurity dynamics and the strategies used by nation-states and cybercriminals. The game helps develop critical thinking, risk management, and decision-making skills, all of which are crucial for cybersecurity professionals.

Key Learning Objectives
Strategic Decision-Making: Understand the importance of planning and resource allocation in cyber operations.
Risk Management: Learn to assess and mitigate cyber risks, prioritizing the protection of critical assets.
Incident Response: Develop skills in responding to cyber attacks and recovering from incidents.
Cyber Threat Intelligence: Gain insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by various cyber actors.
Collaboration and Communication: Improve teamwork and communication skills through collaborative strategies and negotiations.
Ethical Awareness: Explore the ethical implications of offensive and defensive cyber operations.
Deck Composition
Each deck is tailored to represent different cyber actors and includes a mix of offensive and defensive assets, incident response teams, and cyber attacks:

Offensive Assets: APT groups, hacktivist collectives, and nation-state cyber capabilities (e.g., Lazarus Group, Anonymous, APT28).

Defensive Assets: National cyber defense agencies, advanced security tools, and protective measures (e.g., GCHQ, Next-Generation Firewalls, Tor Network).

Cyber Attacks: Real-world malware and cyber weapons used by the selected groups (e.g., Stuxnet, NotPetya, WannaCry).

Incident Response Teams: Specialized teams that help mitigate and respond to cyber incidents, bolstering a player's defenses.
